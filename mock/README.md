# MockLog

## Commands

The {number} job yaml would be generated by the following commands and each number of replica is 1. The yamls can be
deployed to the kubernetes cluster to generate raw logs.

```shell
sh gen.sh {number}
```

## Configuration

You can modify the selector of [mock.yaml](./mock.yaml) to schedule all mock log pods to one node to enhance log
pressure. And you also can change the args of [mock.yaml](./mock.yaml) to modify the log generation frequency.
